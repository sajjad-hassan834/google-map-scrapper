**Local Google Maps lead extraction, operated by Claude.**
Name a business type and a city. Get back a clean, outreach-ready CSV: name, phone, email, website,
category, address, rating, and review count. Optional Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn enrichment.

Everything runs on your machine. No SaaS, no credits, no API keys.

## Why it exists

Ask a chat AI to "scrape Google Maps" and it hits a consent wall and JavaScript-rendered pages. Result:
close to zero structured rows. This kit runs a real headless scraping engine locally and gives Claude
a precise operating manual for it. Result: dozens to hundreds of verified listings per query.

## Capabilities

| | |
|---|---|
| **Lead-ready output** | The engine captures ~34 raw fields. The kit keeps the 8 you contact and qualify with, and writes a CSV. `--full` keeps everything. |
| **Email extraction** | On by default. Pulls contact emails from each business website. |
| **Social enrichment** | `--socials` finds Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn profiles. Runs in code (HTTP + regex), zero AI tokens. |
| **Auto-geocoding** | Type a city name. Coordinates are resolved for you. |
| **Batch jobs** | Many keywords, one job, one CSV. |
| **Claude-native** | A skill plus four slash commands. Claude handles create, poll, download, clean, and present. |
| **Safe defaults** | API bound to `127.0.0.1`, secrets git-ignored, rate-limit and data-law guardrails built into the skill. |

## Quick start

Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Python 3 is optional (standard library only).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahanaicoach/google-maps-scraper-kit.git
cd google-maps-scraper-kit
docker compose up -d
```

### 🌟 Launch the Web Dashboard (Frontend)
Run the built-in UI for finding businesses with **Google Reviews & NO Website**:
```bash
python run_web.py
```
Open **`http://localhost:5000`** in your browser.
- **Dual-Engine Support:** Query using your **Google Places API Key** (ultra-fast, official) OR the **Local Docker Scraper** (`gosom`).
- **High-Intent Lead Filters:** Filter by "No Website Only" (Goldmine for agencies & web designers), "Min Google Reviews" (1+, 5+, 10+), and "Must have phone".
- **Outreach Generator:** Instant cold pitch scripts tailored to each business's review count and missing site.
- **Export Options:** 1-click CSV export, JSON download, and copy all phone numbers.

---

### Command Line Lead Filtering
To filter directly from terminal:
```bash
# Using Google Places API (instant):
python scripts/places_search.py "roofers in Tampa FL" --api-key YOUR_KEY --no-website --min-reviews 1

# Using Local Scraper (free, deeper):
python scripts/scrape.py "handyman in Tampa FL" --city "Tampa, FL" --depth 10 --no-website --min-reviews 1
```

Or run standard scrape:
```bash
./scripts/scrape.sh "coffee shops in Austin TX" 30.2672 -97.7431 5
```

### Example output

`coffee_shops_austin.csv` (illustrative rows):

| title | phone | emails | website | category | address | review_rating | review_count |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Example Roasters | +1 512-555-0101 | hello@example.com | example.com | Coffee shop | 100 Congress Ave, Austin, TX | 4.7 | 812 |
| Sample Espresso Bar | +1 512-555-0102 | info@example.org | example.org | Cafe | 200 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX | 4.5 | 356 |

Add `--socials` for `instagram`, `facebook` and `linkedin` columns, or `--full` for all ~34 raw fields.

## Using it in Claude Code

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/scrape <business> in <city, ST> [depth]` | Run one scrape, return a clean table and CSV |
| `/scrape-batch <keywords-file> [--city "City, ST"]` | Run many queries as one job |
| `/scrape-setup` | Start the engine and run a health check |
| `/scrape-jobs [list \| delete <id>]` | List or delete jobs |

Plain language works too. The skill triggers on requests like *"build me a lead list of dentists in
Denver, CO"* or *"pull Google Maps listings for plumbers in Phoenix"*. It does not scrape social
platforms directly.

### Without Claude

`scripts/scrape.py` is a standalone, dependency-free Python CLI: single queries, batches, geocoding,
socials, CSV output. `scripts/scrape.sh` covers the single-query case in bash.

## Responsible use

This drives a real scraper against Google Maps. Light use is fine. Heavy use without proxies can get
your IP **temporarily rate-limited** (minutes to hours). Your Google account is not affected.

- Run one job at a time. Start at `depth 5` and raise only when needed.
- Watch for block signals: `failed` jobs, empty results, or far fewer rows than an identical earlier run.
- Add proxies for large or repeated runs. The engine rotates them automatically:
  ```json
  "proxies": ["socks5://user:pass@host:port", "http://host2:port2"]
  ```
  Supported: `socks5`, `socks5h`, `http`, `https`.
- Scraping Maps is against Google's Terms of Service. Treat output as leads to verify, not a dataset to
  resell. Phones and emails are personal data: follow GDPR, CCPA, and CAN-SPAM.

For large requests, Claude flags the risk and suggests proxies, then proceeds. It refuses only clearly
abusive use.

## Support

Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Mahanaicoach/google-maps-scraper-kit/issues/new/choose) with
the command you ran and the error. Issues are for problems with the kit. Run your own scrapes with the
quick start above; requests like "find me hotels in Hamburg" are closed without action.
